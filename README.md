- **Security**: Creating a protected environment to run programs
- **To have an understanding of how computers work**: A modern computer and how we use it is defined the OS (the abstractions, how systems work)
- **Applications and Portability**
- **Reliability**: understanding of lots of hardware and software mechanisms that make computer systems hard to crash
- **Files and Program Management**
- **To explore**
